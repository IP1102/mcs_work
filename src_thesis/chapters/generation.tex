\epigraph{Learning without thought is labour lost; thought without learning is perilous.}{--- \textup{Confucius}}

In this chapter, we present an innovative approach that combines reinforcement learning with large language models to fully automate the extract method refactoring process. Our method addresses key limitations of current tools by considering code-specific requirements during the refactoring process. The results show notable improvements in both automated metrics and practical code functionality, demonstrating the potential for reducing manual developer effort in code maintenance.
